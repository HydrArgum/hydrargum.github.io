- [ ]   How can I connect my current netbeans project to a specific repo of mine?
  - [X]   Clone & Merge the remote; Push the local; That's it.
<br><br>
- [ ]   Has the remote settign binded to NetBeans Project, or is it global?
  - [X]   It's binded.
  - [X]   If you dont have a local repo, you can creat it in two ways.  
      1: Clone an existing remote repo;  
      2: Create a local repo from a local working directory.  
  - [X]   If you cloned, you have the connection.
  - [ ]   If you initialised, you can probably build a connection. But how?
