- [X] How can I connect my current netbeans project to a specific repo of mine?
  - [X] Move your workdir (NBP) to the directory, that contain the local .git; Add+; Commit; Push to remote repo;
<br><br>
- [X] Has the remote settign binded to NetBeans Project, or is it global?
  - [X] It's binded.
  - [X] If you dont have a local repo, you can creat it in two ways.  
      1: Clone an existing remote repo;  
      2: Initialise a local repo into a new empty dierctory.  (e.g. c:\Users\username\Documents\GitHub\NewRepoName)
  - [X] If you cloned, you have the connection.
  - [X] If you initialised a new local repo, you can move the content of an existing working directory to this local repo.  
      - [X] Will it working?  
        - [X] First I have to check, weather my existing NBP (NetBeans Project) physically is located in a ".git" directory on my HD, or not?
          - [X] The source and the .git are in the same location, but the source is not in the .git directory.    
              * c:\Users\nkr\Documents\GitHub\portfolio\DesignPatterns\
              * c:\Users\nkr\Documents\GitHub\portfolio\.git 
          - [X] So, Shoud I move my current working director (my project) into the same dir, where my .git is?
            - [X] Actually, I can open my project in NetBeans. But you'd better use your existing repo instead of a new one.
              - [X] Question is: Can I see this as a repo? (Apropo: I just copyed this project into the same dir, as .git)
              - [X] E.g. Can I push it into an existing Remote Repo?
                - [X] No! It couse a damage in the existing Remote Repo. It will overwrite the Master, or somthing like this.
              - [X] OK then! How can I merge my current WD to my existing local repo, and push it to remot?
                - [X] May I just move the WD into the existing local repo?
                  - [X] Proper way: Move & Add & Commit & Push
  - [X] If you initialised, you can probably build a connection. But how?
    - [X] Don't create new local repo for a new project. Use an existing one.
    - [X] Initialisition create a new empty local repo.
      - [X] One repo could enought for a person. Use dictionaries inside your repo insted of different repos.

<br><br>
- [X] How can I delete a repo? Is it enought to delete the .git file? Can I anyway?
  - [X] Yes, you can! Yes it's enought.

<br><br>
- [X] How can I separate my publications within my public repo?
  - [X] What would I separate? The NBproject are in different directories; The README.md can be used to list links for different projects.
  - [ ] Can I create dinamic sites within GitHub?
