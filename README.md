- [ ]   How can I connect my current netbeans project to a specific repo of mine?
  - [X]   Clone & Merge the remote; Push the local; That's it.
<br><br>
- [ ]   Has the remote settign binded to NetBeans Project, or is it global?
  - [X]   It's binded.
  - [X]   If you dont have a local repo, you can creat it in two ways.  
      1: Clone an existing remote repo;  
      2: Initialise a local repo into a new empty dierctory.  (e.g. c:\Users\username\Documents\GitHub\NewRepoName)
  - [X]   If you cloned, you have the connection.
  - [X]   If you initialised a new local repo, you can move the content of an existing working directory to this local repo.  
      - [ ]   Will it working?  
        - [ ]  First I have to check, is my existing NBP (NetBeanProject) phisicaly located in a ".git" directory on my HD?
          - [X] The source and the .git are in the same location, but the source is not in the .git directory.    
              * c:\Users\nkr\Documents\GitHub\portfolio\DesignPatterns\
              * c:\Users\nkr\Documents\GitHub\portfolio\.git 
          - [ ] So, Shoud I move my current working director (my project) into the same dir, where my .git is?
            - [X]  Actually, I can open my project in NetBeans.
              - [ ] Question is: Can I see this as a repo? (Apropo: I just copyed this project into the same dir, as .git)
              - [ ] E.g. Can I push it into an existing Remote Repo?
                - [X] No! It couse a damage in the existing Remote Repo. It will overwrite the Master, or somthing like this.
              - [ ] OK then! How can I merge my current WD to my existing local repo, and push it to remot?
                - [ ] May I just move the WD into the existing local repo?
                  - [ ] CHK...
              
- [ ]   How can I check this?
  - [ ]   If you initialised, you can probably build a connection. But how?
  - [ ]   Can I create repo with the content of an exitsting working directory?
      
<br><br>
- [ ]   How can I delete a repo? Is it enought to delete the .git file?
  - [O]   CHK...
