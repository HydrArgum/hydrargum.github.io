If there is an "index.html" it gets the priority against of "README.md" <br>
<br>
So if you have an "index.html" in a given directory, it is not possible to show persent the "README.md".
The "a href="https://hydrargum.github.io/README.md" links to the content of the "README.md", so it will not be translate and present.
<br>

This file is "index.html"
<br>
Go to <a href="https://hydrargum.github.io/portfolio">https://hydrargum.github.io/portfolio (/README.md)</a> <br>
